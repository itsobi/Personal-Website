          <p>
            From the highest of the highs to the lowest of the lows... I've been
            through it all. From suffering a season-ending injury my senior year
            of high school, subsequently losing all of my scholarships, to
            playing as a walk-on True Freshman at Oklahoma State. Then,
            transferring the end of my freshman year to a school in West
            Virginia, which I couldn't even point to on the map (shout out to
            Marshall U!). To my true senior year at Marshall, having to sit out
            9 games my final year due to injury, then Grad-Transferring to The
            University of Oklahoma amid a global pandemic... <br />
            <br />
            Later on being named a starter for week 1, to receiving a call the
            Thursday of game week, I would be placed in quarantine for 2 weeks
            due to a positive COVID-19 test. Only to come back and suffer a
            season-ending injury, my first practice back. (this is the short
            version by the way) <br />
            <br />
            I say all of this because, no matter what happens in life, it KEEPS
            going! <br />
            And itâ€™s on you to continue to find happiness. A little adversity
            ain't gonna hurt, it's only going to make you stronger! <br /><br />
            In my opinion, the time away from the game was a huge blessing in
            disguise. Yes, there were a lot of sleepless nights,emptiness, and
            the feeling of lost time, but, on the other hand, it allowed me the
            fortitude to decompress and think about life beyond football. Which
            in fact, I was able to find a love and passion outside of those
            white lines... <br />
